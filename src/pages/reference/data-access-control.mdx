Providing your network of **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** organizations
with access to your data is controlled by your organization's **data access
control policy**.

</PageDescription>

## Data access control policies

Data access control policies grant data access to your partner
organizations&mdash;your supply chain partners and business transaction
partners&mdash;based on two factors: **data type** and **supply chain proximity**.

**Attention**: For any data uploaded using the spreadsheets upload method or the
XML upload method, your organization's **data access control policy** can be
overridden by specifying an **Entitlement-Mode** value for that upload.

**Data types:**

1. Product (item) and facility (location) data
2. Product events (Aggregation, Transformation, etc.)
3. Business transactions (PO, DA, RA)
4. Documents (PDFs and other files)
5. User-defined data types (such as test results or temperature readings)

**Supply chain proximity:**

1. Transaction partner (direct exchange of the product instance -- item / EPC); or
2. Supply chain partner (shared product instance but no direct exchange of item / EPC).

IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ provides a choice between two **data access control policies**
for your organization:

1. **Policy 1 - Source to destination transparency** OR
2. **Policy 2 - One up, one down transparency**

## Policy 1 - Source to destination transparency

As the name suggests, the **Source to destination transparency** data access
control policy enables your data to be shared up and down the full length of
the supply chain for any specific product instance (item / EPC). However, any other
organization along that supply chain can halt this sharing by restricting access
to their data. You can therefore guarantee only that your transaction partners
(which can be viewed as adjacent supply chain partners) can view your shared data.
Your transaction partners always have the capability to block further sharing,
because their data uploads are required in order to continue the chain of data access.

For this reason, it is important to understand that the enablement of *sharing*
your data with your intended supply chain partners does not necessarily guarantee
their capability for *viewing* it.

**Data shared with ALL supply chain partners and transaction partners:**
Product events and product (item) and location (facility) data for a lot, pallet,
or container are shared with the organizations that send and/or receive that lot,
pallet, or container. Business transaction data (such as purchase orders and
shipping notices) are always restricted to the transaction partner only.

**Example:** ALL events and product and location data that reference the same
peanut butter cookies lot are shared with all supply chain partners and transaction
partners for the lot.

**Data shared ONLY with the transaction partner:**
Business transactions&mdash;including Purchase Order (PO), Despatch Advice (DA/ASN),
and Receiving Advice (RA) data&mdash;are shared with and visible to **ONLY** the transaction
partner involved in the specific exchange of the product instance.

**Example:** The Purchase Order for a peanut butter cookies lot, sent by the retailer
to a supplier (transaction partners), is not shared with any other organization on
the supply chain for the lot.

**Note:** Any **user-defined data types** that reference the lot are **private**
and viewable only by the uploading organization.

## Policy 2 - One up, one down transparency

As the name suggests, the **One up, one down transparency** policy is more restrictive
than the **Source to destination transparency** policy. The One up, one down transparency
policy limits sharing of all data to ONLY your transaction partners (which can be
viewed as adjacent supply chain partners). Your transaction partners have no capability
to share the data further up or down the supply chain.

**Data shared only with the transaction partner:**
Product events, product and location data, and transaction data&mdash;including
Purchase Order (PO), Despatch Advice (DA/ASN), and Receive Advice (RA) documents&mdash;are visible
**ONLY** to the transaction partner involved in the specific exchange of the product
instance.

**Example:** Event data for the receiving of peanut butter cookie ingredients for the
lot, uploaded by the ingredients receiver, is visible ONLY to the supplier of the
ingredients (the transaction partner for the event).

**Note:** Any **user-defined data types** that reference the lot are **private** and
viewable only by the uploading organization.
