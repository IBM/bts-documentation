<PageDescription>

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** enables your **organization** to trace the physical
movement and status of products on your supply chain, and to make this data
available to your selected business partners. To help achieve this goal, IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
implements the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis" target="_blank">GS1
Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS)</a> standards.

## EPCIS and IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™

Using EPCIS standards, supply chain events that describe products and facilities
registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ can be uploaded to the network. This event data can
then be traced on IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ to show end-to-end supply chain flows for specific
product instances. The following six EPCIS events are defined in IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™;
uploading these event types enables authorized users to trace and view supply chain
data for the specified products.

### Commission Event

A **Commission Event** describes a new product instance being created, such as when
harvested lettuce arrives at a processing plant. Commission events can describe
products that are tracked in lots or batches, or those tracked individually.
Uploading a commission event to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ creates the product instance on the
network, and does not necessarily correlate with the time when the actual product
was harvested or created. For example, if a batch of lettuce is harvested from a
farm that is not yet defined to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, the batch would not be commissioned
until it arrives at a processing facility that is registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.
Each instance of an end-to-end supply chain starts with a commission event that
instantiates, or creates, a new product instance on IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

### Decommission Event

A **Decommission Event** describes a product instance being removed from the supply
chain. A decommission event is essentially the inverse of a commission event. For
example, decommission can occur when there is a product loss due to spoilage or
contamination. Like commission events, decommission events occur on the supply chain
before they are uploaded to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ and reflected in product traces.

### Aggregation Event

An **Aggregation Event** describes one or more instances of a product or products
being combined into a larger container (pallet or SSCC) for shipment. Shipment can
occur between facilities within your organization or to another organization. The
aggregation event will include details on the shipping of the container (Despatch
Advice or Advance Shipping Notice) such as source, destination and Purchase Order
(PO). For example, one lot of lettuce and one lot of broccoli are combined (aggregated)
onto one pallet for shipping.

### Disaggregation Event

A **Disaggregation Event** describes the separation of items that were combined in
an aggregation event. A disaggregation event is essentially the inverse of an aggregation
event. The product instances combined in the aggregation event are separated into
their original forms. For example, a received pallet is separated (disaggregated)
into one lot of lettuce and one lot of broccoli.

### Transformation Event

A **Transformation Event** describes the irreversible changing or combining of a
product or products to create a new product. For example, multiple leafy greens are
transformed by being pureed into an energy drink.

### Observation Event

An **Observation Event** describes any recording of a product instance on the supply chain that does
not change the status of the product (or match any of the other six supported events). For example,
a batch of lettuce is observed during an inspection of the product. If the inspection does not
create, destroy, transform, pack, or unpack the lettuce, this is an observation event.

## About EPCIS Events

EPCIS events can be described as defining the what, where, when, and why of supply chain events:

**What** - The product lots or batches involved in an event.

**Where** - The facility or location where the event occurred.

**When** - The time and date of the event.

**Why** - Business transaction documents, such as Purchase Orders (POs), Despatch Advice/Advanced Shipping Notices, and Receive Advice.

## Uploading EPCIS Events

IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ supports uploading EPCIS events in the GS1 standardized XML
format. Annotated EPCIS XML files are provided, which contain all available elements and comments
for each event type You can use these XML files as templates to generate your own EPCIS event files
for uploading to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

EPCIS events can be uploaded to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ using either of the following methods:

1. Using XML:
  a. Build Product Scenarios and save the results as XML templates.
  b. Replace the template data with your real data, or submit it as test data.
  c. Upload your XML using the Connector API.
2. Using spreadsheets:
  a. Download the applicable EPCIS event spreadsheet template.
  b. Add the data for the event to the spreadsheet.
  c. Upload the data using the spreadsheet bulk upload page in the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ UI.
