<PageDescription>

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** supports data entitlement (data access) specifications for
all XML documents uploaded to the network. With the data access control
policy selected by your organization, specifying an optional entitlement mode
when uploading XML enables control over sharing data (such as events, transactions and
documents) with other organizations.

## Data entitlement specifications

The data uploader can specify a data entitlement mode for each XML document at the
time of submission, as follows:

**Private**: The data is only visible to the submitting organization, unless it is
shared via **explicit grants** (e.g. event data pertaining to an organization’s
internal processes, or location master data for private locations).

**Restricted**: The data is shared only with the organizations that are **explicitly
referenced** in the XML document. These are typically business transaction partners
who are identified in Purchase Order, Despatch Advice (ASN) and Receiving Advice documents.

**Linked**: The data is enabled for sharing with all organizations up and down the
supply chain for a specific trade item (GTIN). These are typically supply chain events,
which are shared through a process of cross-referencing data such as facility IDs and
event IDs.

**Default**: Applies the default entitlement mode per type of document, as described in
**Table 1** below.

**Attention**: Specifying a **Data entitlement mode** on your data upload API calls
supersedes your organization's data access control policy.

## Assigning entitlement mode on data submission

Entitlement mode is specified using the **IFT-Entitlement-Mode** header in the data
submission request. **If an entitlement mode is not specified**, the default entitlement
mode is applied, based on the type of XML document (Table 1):

Table 1. Default entitlement modes

| Default entitlement mode | Document type |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Restricted        | Purchase Order transactions, Despatch Advice transactions (DA/ASN), Receive Advice transactions      |
| Linked    | EPCIS Events, Item master data, Location master data, Documents  |
| Private  | Payload data |


### Valid entitlement mode headers on data submission

 - **Restricted:** **IFT-Entitlement-Mode: restricted**
 - **Linked:** **IFT-Entitlement-Mode: linked**
 - **Private:** **IFT-Entitlement-Mode: private**

If no **IFT-Entitlement-Mode** header is provided on data submission, the default mode
will be applied based on the XML document type, as described previously in Table 1.

Specifying an invalid entitlement mode value will return the following error message:

```json
{
  "message": "bad_entitlement_mode_value is not a valid IFT-Entitlement-Mode header value!"
}
```
