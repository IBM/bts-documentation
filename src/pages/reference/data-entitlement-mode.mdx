<PageDescription>

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** provides data entitlement (data access)
specifications for all data uploaded to the ecosystem. Along with
the [data access control](data-access-control) policy selected by your organization,
entitlement mode enables control over sharing data (including events, transactions
and documents) with your supply chain partner organizations.

## Data entitlement specifications

The data uploader can specify a data entitlement mode for each XML document at the
time of submission, as follows:

**Private**: The data is only visible to the submitting organization, unless it is
shared via **explicit grant** (e.g. event data pertaining to an organization’s
internal processes, or location master data for private locations or pieces of
equipment).

**Restricted**: The data is shared only with the organizations that are **explicitly
referenced** in the XML document. These are typically business transaction partners
that are identified in Purchase Order, Despatch Advice (aka ASN) and Receiving Advice
transactions.

**Linked**: The data is enabled for sharing with all organizations up and down the
supply chain for a specific trade item such as an SGTIN. These are typically supply
chain events, which are shared through a process of cross-referencing data such as
facility IDs and event IDs.

**Default**: Applies the default entitlement mode per data type, as described in
**Table 1** below.

**Attention**: Specifying a **data entitlement mode** with your data upload API calls
supersedes your organization's [data access control](data-access-control) policy.

## Assigning entitlement mode on data submission

Entitlement mode is specified using the **IFT-Entitlement-Mode** header in the
XML data submission request. **If an entitlement mode is not specified**, the
default entitlement mode is applied, based on the type of XML (Table 1):

Table 1. Default entitlement modes

| Default entitlement mode | Data type |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Restricted        | Purchase Order transactions, Despatch Advice transactions (DA/ASN), Receiving Advice transactions      |
| Linked    | EPCIS Events, Item master data, Location master data  |
| Private  | Payload* <br /> Documents** |

&#42; Data submitted as a Payload is expected to have explicit overrides for non-private use.
&#42;&#42; Documents, including PDFs and other file and format types, uploaded using the Documents application.


### Valid entitlement mode headers on data submission

 - **Restricted:** **IFT-Entitlement-Mode: restricted**
 - **Linked:** **IFT-Entitlement-Mode: linked**
 - **Private:** **IFT-Entitlement-Mode: private**

If no **IFT-Entitlement-Mode** header is provided on data submission, the default mode
will be applied based on the XML data type, as described previously in Table 1.

Specifying an invalid entitlement mode value will return the following error message:

```json
{
  "message": "bad_entitlement_mode_value is not a valid IFT-Entitlement-Mode header value!"
}
```
