The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** **Trace** module enables authorized users to view and take
action on supply chain data, such as products, facilities, events and transactions.
Integrated supply chain data&mdash;data shared by two or more organizations&mdash;is
traceable by organizations that upload, and provide access to, data that references
the same product instance. This sharing of data enables IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ business
partners to trace the same product instance along their supply chains.

## About traceability

End-to-end product traceability on IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ means that authorized users can easily
find and trace the path of their organization's product instances along the supply
chain. The Trace module enables member organizations to trace supply chain assets:

* IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ Trace examples include identifying a product instance that originated from
a specific source (facility), includes a specific ingredient, or has an approaching expiration date.
* Authorized users trace a product by locating its identifiers, such as product ID, lot number,
purchase order number, or facility ID.
* Trace results can be narrowed by specifying additional parameters, including date and time range,
event type, or facility type.
* Owners of data maintain complete control over which organizations can trace their data - by
choosing a **Data access policy** and setting ACL permissions (Data entitlement mode) when uploading data.

## How to trace

The following procedure describes how to trace products in IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™:

1. Once you are logged into IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, select the Trace module from the main menu.
2. Click on the icon to start the product trace.
3. You can search by product ID (such as GTIN), product label, or purchase order.

5. You can also use a date range for a purchase order's expected delivery date.
6. Once you are done narrowing down your search, click Trace.
7. The trace results for the GTIN and the filter that was applied are displayed. Transactions,
locations, and the date range associated with the GTIN are displayed. Organizations associated
with the GTIN are also displayed, depending on the data sharing specifications used by the data owner.
