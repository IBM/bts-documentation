The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** **Documents** module enables your **organization** to upload,
view and share documents, such as facility certificates and audit reports. You can
search the **Document library** for your organization by selecting variables such as
the owning organization, facility, document type and expiration date.

## Getting started

To launch the module, expand the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ main menu and select **Documents**.

## Document library

When you launch the **Documents** module, the **Document library** for your organization
is displayed.

To add a new document, click **Upload**. To search for a document, make your selections
from the drop-down menus and click **Find**. To view all documents, documents owned by
your organization, or documents shared with your organization, make your selection from
the **Owning organization** menu.

Depending on the authorization assigned to the user, the **View**, **Share** and **Delete**
icons are available to the right of each document. No user can be authorized to share or
delete a document that is owned by another organization.

## Upload document

From your **Document library**, click **Upload** to upload a document. On the **Upload
document** page, select a **Document category** and a **Document type**. Complete
the remaining fields, which will vary depending on your selected **Document type**:

**File** - Click **Add file** to browse for the document PDF or image (PNG, JPEG, or GIF)
file. (Note: 20 MB is the maximum size per file, including attachments.)

**Properties** (optional) - Enter a **Document title**, **Expiration date** and **Issue date**.

**Notes** (optional) - Enter any informational comments or notes about this document.

**Focus** (optional) - Identify a Facility ID as the document focus to share a linked
document with any organization with access to the facility master data or Trace events
for the facility ID.

**Upload** - At the bottom of the page, click **Upload** to upload your document to
the **Document library** for your organization. The document will also be enabled for
viewing by your selected document sharing organizations.

## View document

To view a document, click the **Document type** link or the **View document** icon from
your **Document library**. The selected document will be displayed.

You can **Download** the document, view the **Facility** for the document, and view the
organizations that are authorized to view the document.

## Share document

To share a document with another organization, click the **Share document** icon
from the **Document library** page, or click **Share** from the **View document** page.

Organizations that you have already shared the document with are selected on the left
and listed on the right. You can add organizations to share the document with from the
list on the left. You can remove any organizations from sharing for the document from
the list on the right.

Click **Share** to explicitly share the document with specific organizations for the
first time. Or click **Update** to add or remove authorization for organizations to view
a previously shared document.

## Delete document

To delete a document, click the **Delete** icon from your **Document library**, or
click **Delete** from the **View document** page. A confirmation dialog will be displayed.

**Note:** The document will be deleted from the Document library for your organization and
from IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. Any organizations that you have shared the document with will no longer be
able to view it. Records of all actions taken for this document will remain on IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.
