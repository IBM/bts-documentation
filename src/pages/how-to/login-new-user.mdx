Once your **organization** has joined IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, new human users can only be added
by an **Account Admin**. In the **Users** module, the administrator enters each
new user's name and **email address** (and assigns user roles).

## Login prerequisites

To successfully log in to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, each human user must have an IBMid that is
registered with **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**. One of the following scenarios will apply:

1. If you **do not have an IBMid** (or would like an additional IBMid for IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
 login): [**Sign up for an IBMid**](#sign-up-for-an-ibmid), ensuring that your IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
 login email address is your IBMid email address. Record your IBMid password in a secure
 location for logging in  to the solution.
1. If you **already have an IBMid that is registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**: No further
steps are required&mdash;you can proceed to <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/'}>**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**</a> and log in with
your **existing IBMid and password**.
1. You **have an IBMid that is NOT registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**: Either: a) Your
**Account Admin** can change your email address in the <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'}>**Users module**</a>
to match your IBMid email address, **OR** b) You can register an additional IBMid email
address that is also your IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ login email address (see below).

## Sign up for an IBMid

If you do not have a registered IBMid that is registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, create a
new (or additional) [**IBMid**](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html) using the
following steps. Your new IBMid **MUST** be the email address that is registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™:

1. Open your IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ new user login email message (if applicable) and click on the link
to [**Sign up for an IBMid**](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html).
2. On the IBM [**Create your account**](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html)
page, complete the **Sign up for an IBMid** form. **IMPORTANT:** Your IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ registration
email address must also be your IBMid email address; **record your IBMid and password**.
3. You **MUST return to your email account** to verify your new **IBMid** registration. You will receive
a new email from IBM with an **IBMid registration verification code**. Copy the verification code from
the email, and click the link in the email to enter the code to complete your IBMid registration.
4. You are now ready to log in to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™! Proceed to <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'}>
**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**</a> and log in with your new IBMid and password.
