An **Account admin** for your organization must create your
onboarding team, which should include your supply chain experts and data
integration specialists. The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** **Onboarding team member**
role authorizes users in your organization to upload product data, such as
supply chain events and transactions.

## Onboarding team

Before adding an **Onboarding team member** user, ensure that the user has a
registered <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html" target="_blank">
IBMid</a> for authenticating to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. Then add their name, and the email address used
to register their IBMid, to the **Onboarding team member** role in the Onboarding module.

## Onboarding data

Data that each **Onboarding team member** user will upload include GS1, or IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
identifiers (IDs) for products and raw materials, and also for facilities
(locations), such as manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and warehouses.

Your onboarding team will also upload business **transaction data**, such as Purchase Orders,
Despatch Advice (Advanced Shipping Notice) and Receive Advice documents, and **event data**,
such as product Commission, Aggregation, and Transformation events. Uploading facility inspection
and licensing certificates, and related documents, is also supported through the Documents module.
