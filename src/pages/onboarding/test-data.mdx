## Supplier data

The following data types must be uploaded by product suppliers (organizations):

1. [**Unique product identifiers**](/reference/data-types#master-data) - Can include GS-1 GTINs
or IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ product identifiers, mapping from **GTINs** to **SKUs** and **UPCs**,
and product descriptions. If you do not have a GS-1 identifier for a product, you can
choose to register for an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ product identifier in the **Onboarding** module.
2. [**Unique location identifiers**](/reference/data-types#master-data) - Can include **GS-1
GLNs**, **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ facility identifiers**, and **location descriptions**, such
as facility type, number, address, and contact information. If you do not have a GS-1
identifier for a facility, you can choose to register for an **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ facility
identifier** in the **Onboarding** module.
3. [**Lot or batch identifier**](/reference/data-types#instancelot-master-data-(ilmd)) - The lot or
batch number that uniquely identifies the shipment for the product instance.
4. [**Events**](/reference/data-types#epcis-events) - Must include a time and date stamp and
references to any **Purchase Orders**, **Despatch Advice (DA)**, **EPCIS Events** (with
lot number), receiver **Disaggregation** and **Observation** events, processor **Disaggregation**,
**Aggregation**, **Observation** and **Transformation** events, and shipper **Aggregation**
and **Observation** events.

Note: Additional [data types](/reference/data-types) are supported but not required.
