Successful onboarding to **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** means registered users in
your **organization** have uploaded critical product supply chain
data&mdash;such as events and transactions&mdash;and shared them with
your selected IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ business partners. Once your organization has
completed onboarding, you can start extracting value through additional IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
[modules](/modules/modules-overview), such as [Trace](/modules/trace)
and [Documents](/modules/documents).
