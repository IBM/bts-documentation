<PageDescription>

The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** **Data** module enables users assigned to
the **Onboarding team member** role for your organization to easily view and register
products and facilities. Authorized users can also upload spreadsheets data, download
data, and review or change the data access control policy for your organization.

## How it works

The **Data** module reads from your organization's data archives and displays the registered
facilities and products. Using the spreadsheet bulk upload page, authorized users can download
and complete data templates for uploading as XML. Using the **Download data**
page, authorized users can download the latest 500 uploads.
