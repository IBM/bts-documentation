changes in activity, by week, month or year.

## How it works

The **Activity** module displays the latest activity from your organization by
collecting monitored data:

- Usage: organizations, users, unique logons and trace.
- Data upload: records, uploads and errors.
- Pallets shipped: pallets shipped to and from your organization.

Changes in activity are also indicated. Clicking on any graph or chart expands the view.
