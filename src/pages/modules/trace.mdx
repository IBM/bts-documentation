The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** **Trace** module enables member **organizations**
to trace their products along their supply chains and share that data with their
authorized supply chain partners.

</PageDescription>

## How it works

The **Trace** module enables your **organization** to view, share, and take action on
supply chain data, such as products, facilities, events, transactions, and certificates.
**Integrated supply chain data**&mdash;data shared by two or more organizations&mdash;is
traceable when information referencing the same product instance has been uploaded by
authorized organizations. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ supply chain partners are therefore enabled to
trace the same specific product instance, if access has been **authorized by the organization**
that owns the data.

**Trace** examples include identifying a product instance that originated from a specific
source location (facility), includes a specific ingredient (product or item), or has an approaching expiration date:

- Authorized users trace a product by finding its registered GS1 or IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
**identifier**, such as Product ID, Lot Number, Purchase Order Number, or Facility ID.
- Trace results can be narrowed by specifying additional parameters, including date and
time range, event type, or facility type.
- Each organization owns its data and maintains control over which organizations can
trace its data by setting a [Data entitlement mode](/reference/data-entitlement-mode)
when uploading data to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.
