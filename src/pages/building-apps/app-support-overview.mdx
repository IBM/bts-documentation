<PageDescription>

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** member organizations submit supply chain data to the platform and authorize it to be shared with other
select members. **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** then collects and integrates this data, creating comprehensive, end-to-end supply
chain views specific to each organization. This data management method enables the development of applications aimed at
increasing product availability, reducing supply chain inefficiencies and minimizing waste.

## Building apps overview

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** provides pre-built applications by subscription, including product **Trace**, product **Insights**, member
**Onboarding** and **Documents** management. To support the development of additional applications, **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** provides
several methods to choose from: **APIs**, **data subscription** and **smart contracts**. These methods can be used individually,
or in combination, to extend data to both private client-specific applications and public generally-available applications.

## Choosing a method

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** shares its application development methods and capabilities with member organizations for building
applications for private or commercial use. Applications create value by using integrated data from across the **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**
supply chain, transcending organizational boundaries and providing innovation and insight.

To build applications, use one of the three supported methods individually, or in combination:

1. Use the **APIs** method when your top priority is ease of use and speed of deployment.
2. Use the **data subscription** method when your top priority is analyzing the value of data at scale.
3. Use the **smart contracts** method when your top priority is transparency and trust between transacting parties.

### APIs method

The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** APIs are provided on Swagger for registered and authenticated third-party applications to submit data requests.
Only the applications that are authorized by each data owner can successfully retrieve that data:

- <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/connector/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Connector API</a> (upload data)
- <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/converter/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Converter API</a> (convert spreadsheets)
- <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/outbound/api-docs/'} target="_blank">Trace API</a> (trace products)
- <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/documents/api-docs/'} target="_blank">Documents API</a> (share documents)
- <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/visibility/api-docs/'} target="_blank">Insights API</a> (view metrics)

For details, refer to [Building apps from API data](/building-apps/app-support-apis).

### Data subscription method

**Data subscription** enables authorized applications to retrieve formatted **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** data for
efficient consumption. Subscription data is provided in tabular format, stored off-blockchain in
IBM Cloud Object Store, and updated and retrieved via automation. For details, refer to [Building apps
from data subscription](/building-apps/app-support-data-subscription).

### Smart contracts method

**Smart contracts** enables authorized third-parties to retrieve and process unencrypted **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**
data. To protect sensitive information, private smart contracts run on private network channels. For
details, refer to [Building apps from smart contracts](/building-apps/app-support-smart-contracts).
