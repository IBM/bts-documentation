**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** enables authorized private smart contracts (chaincode programs) to operate on data uploaded and shared
by organizations. Using this method of building applications, a subscription invokes the smart contract and passes it the applicable
data for events, transactions, products and locations. Transaction privacy is ensured through execution on a private channel&mdash;which
includes only the parties to the smart contract&mdash;to allow for processing sensitive information such as pricing and contract terms.

## When to choose this method

Choose the smart contracts method of building applications when your top priority is the transparency and trust that blockchain
provides to transacting parties.

## About smart contracts

**Smart contracts**, which are written in chaincode, allow participants on a blockchain network to encode business logic in
executable programs. Smart contracts can run on private peers, owned by specific network members, against the trusted, verified
data hosted by those peers. Therefore, the business rules encoded in the smart contract are enforced in a manner that provides
trust and transparency for all parties to the smart contract.

Smart contracts can be appropriate for use cases ranging from dispute resolution to penalty calculation and compliance assessment.
Smart contract logic can also form the basis of trusted capabilities for financing, invoicing, insurance and additional business
requirements.
