## When to choose this method

Choose the **data subscription** method of building applications when your top priority is analyzing the value of data at scale
and building your own applications to achieve that value.

## About data subscription

**Data subscription** supports the large-scale, subscription-based export of **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** data in raw relational format,
paired with SDKs to facilitate development of novel applications for that data. This method of data extraction lends itself to
integration with client proprietary data and analytics and makes the data scalable, ingestible and comprehensible for client
applications.

After creating a subscription to this method, **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** writes batches of data to your IBM Cloud Object Store account.
You can then bind this formatted, unencrypted data to your proprietary business intelligence infrastructure, for predictive, analytic,
business logic or machine learning applications. The result is data insights resulting from a relational data set, in graphic form,
all with minimal new code.

## Availability

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** **data subscription** is currently a Limited Availability feature. The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** team can work with
you to help you understand how the subscriptions work and how to enable your applications to ingest data from IBM Cloud Object Store.
