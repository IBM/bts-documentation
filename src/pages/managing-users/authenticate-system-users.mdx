<PageDescription>

Use the following procedures to register and authenticate **system users** to make API
calls to **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**. This is a key step towards automating your data uploads
to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

</PageDescription>

## System users

A **system user** is an automated program, or an application, that sends or receives data
by specifying a **service ID/API key** token combination. A system user can be a combination
of multiple programs, or applications, in which case they share the same token. Registering
multiple system users with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ can be useful for managing distinct workloads, such
as processing certificates and sending messages, and to separate information types on your local system.

To configure a new system user, you must first create a new **service ID/API key** pair. You will
then register the system user with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ by defining its service ID and API key in
the **Users** module. Once registered, the **system user** will generate an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
**service token**, in order to make authenticated API calls, using the following sequence:

1. Specify the API key to request an IBM Cloud IAM token.
2. Exchange the IBM Cloud IAM token for an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token, which contains the service ID and password.
3. Specify the service token in the authorization header of API calls to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.
4. Because service tokens expire three hours after being issued, either renew the token before
expiration or repeat this process to generate a new service token.

**Attention: The specific process and detailed steps are described below.**

## Configure a system user

A one-time initial registration is required to allow a new **system user** to authenticate
to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. Only an **Account admin** for your **organization** can register system
users. An **Account admin** must first create a unique service ID and API key pair for each system
user, as follows:

1. **Log in** to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ and select the <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'} target="_blank">**Users**</a> module.
1. Select **System IDs** and then click **Add System ID**.
1. Enter a **name** for your new System ID, and then click the text link to **create a new service ID on IBM Cloud**.
1. Log in to IBM Cloud using your IBMid (email address registered with IBM).
1. Select the **Service IDs** tab from the left menu.
1. Click the **Create +** button.
1. Enter a Name and Description for your service ID.
1. Select the **API keys** tab and click the **Create +** button.
1. Enter a name and description for your API key and click the **Create +** button.
1. **ATTENTION!** Click the eye icon and **copy and save the API key value to your local system!**
This is your only opportunity to save and record the API key value, which you will need later for automation.
Your downloaded and saved API key (JSON) should look similar to the following example:
  ```json
    {
        "name": "Solution API key",
        "description": "My Solution API key",
        "createdAt": "2018-05-03T16:00+0000",
        "apiKey": "wZvu952...gcci"
    }
  ```
1. Close the API key window. From the subsequent **Manage Mysystem ID** window, copy the service ID value **ServiceId-######**.
1. Return to the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ **Add System ID** dialog. Paste the service ID value copied from the previous step
into the service ID field, and then click the **Add System ID** button.
1. The new **System ID** will be displayed in your IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ Users panel.

## Obtain an IBM Cloud IAM token

After you have registered the new **service ID**, the **system user** must generate an **IBM Cloud IAM token** using
the following steps (an automated process):

1. Copies the following cURL command:
`bash curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data "grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey" --data "apikey=<API_KEY>" https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token`
2. Replaces `<API_KEY>` with the **apiKey** value from the JSON key file, and runs the command.
3. Receives a response similar to the following example:
```json
{
  "access_token" : "eyJraWQiOiIyMDE3M...",
  "token_type"   : "Bearer",
  "expires_in"   : 3600,
  "expiration"   : 1523646898
}
```

## Exchange an IBM Cloud IAM token for a service token

After obtaining an IBM Cloud IAM token, the system user must exchange it for an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token:

**Windows users:** Use an application such as <a href="https://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> to
run the following curl commands.

1. The system user copies the following cURL command:
`bash curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d 'IAM_RESP_BODY' https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/identity-proxy/exchange_token/v1/organization/{ProductionOrganizationId}`
1. The system user replaces `IAM_RESP_BODY` with the IBM Cloud IAM JSON object ("access_token" value) returned
from the previous [Obtain an IBM Cloud IAM token](#obtain-an-ibm-cloud-iam-token) step.
1. The system user replaces `{organizationId}` with the organization ID and runs the command:
**Example:** (expanded JSON)

```bash
curl - X POST - H 'Content-Type: application/json' - d '
{
	"access_token": "eyJraWQ...",
	"refresh_token": "J1AV0...",
	"token_type": "Bearer",
	"expires_in": 3600,
	"expiration": 1525367304
}
' https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/identity-proxy/exchange_token/v1/organization/38d1...
```
**Attention:** The organization ID is available from the **SYSTEM IDS** tab in the **Users module**.
1. The system user receives a response similar to the following example:
`{ "onboarding_token" : "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR...", }`
2. In the authorization header of API calls, the system user specifies the **onboarding_token** key
(in the JSON object returned by the command), as **Bearer &lt;token&gt;**. The token expires three hours after being issued:
`Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR...`

## Token expiration

Both the IBM Cloud IAM token and the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token are encoded with an expiration time. During
the token exchange, the expiration time is copied from the IBM Cloud IAM token and applied to the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
service token, so they will both expire at the same time.

If an expired IBM Cloud IAM token is sent with an exchange token request, it will be rejected. If an
expired IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token is submitted with an API call, it will be rejected.

## Troubleshooting

To resolve issues with system user configuration, use the following steps:

**Issue:** Receiving a 404 response when exchanging an IBM Cloud IAM token for an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token:

Example response:
```json
{
  “ok”: false,
  “statusCode”: 404,
  “error”: “User Id: {SERVICE_ID} not found with solution Id: {SOLUTION_ID} and organization Id: {ORGANIZATION_ID}”
}
```

**Action:**

1. Verify that the service ID is registered as a system user in the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ **Users** module.

   If the system ID is not registered, follow the instructions to [Register a system user](#register-a-system-user).

2. Verify that the correct URL is being targeted in the CURL command:
    Command:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d 'IAM_RESP_BODY' https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/identity-proxy/exchange_token/v1/organization/{ProductionOrganizationId}
    ```

3. Verify that the correct organization ID is being specified in the CURL command. There are separate
organization IDs for each corresponding zone. For example, if targeting the Integration zone, you must
provide the Integration zone organization ID. If the organization ID is unknown for the corresponding
zone, it can be found in the `SYSTEM IDS` tab under the `Users` section of the UI.
