description: Using Java to programmatically exchange system user tokens
---

<PageDescription>

The <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/docs/files/as-is-code-samples/IBMFoodTrust-java-springboot-sample.tgz'}>Java sample</a>
(tar file) leverages the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a>
framework to programmatically manage the system user authentication process of obtaining an
IBM Cloud IAM token and exchanging it for a service ID token. You can use this code to start
automating your data uploads to **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**.

</PageDescription>

## Usage

With a nominal configuration change, the code (web service) can be deployed and run
in your environment. When the service starts, the API key stored in the configuration
file is read and the token exchange is executed. When the API is called, the expiration
time on the token is checked and automatically renewed if it is expired. The inbound
payload is then transmitted to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ and the result is returned.

The service utilizes Spring Boot and <a href="https://gradle.org" target="_blank">Gradle</a>
and was built for the following versions:

- Java 8
- Gradle 4.2.1
- Spring Boot 1.5.13.&lt;release&gt;

## Disclaimer

This code is provided to help you get up and running quickly with authentication and data
submission to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. This code will be maintained for any future authentication
changes, but it is **not recommended that this code be used "as-is"**. In an enterprise
environment, additional requirements may be dictated by your organization, such as logging,
unit tests, health endpoints, statistics and endpoints.

## Configuration

You must configure the service prior to running it, using a **config.properties** file similar
to the sample shown below. The service analyzes the value of the **iftEnvironment** variable;
if the value is **SANDBOX**, the sandbox environment properties are used. In all other cases,
the **PRODUCTION** environment is assumed.

Specifically, you must configure the following variables:

- The API key and organization ID that were used in the [initial token setup steps](/managing-users/authenticate-system-users).
- The IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ environment ("SANDBOX" or "PRODUCTION")

Sample **config.properties** file:

```
  iftApiKey=8r...sv
  iftEnvironment=SANDBOX
  iftCloudIAMURL=https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token
  iftIntegrationOrgId=9dd5c...a1
  iftIntegrationAuthURL=https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/identity-proxy/exchange_token/v1/organization/
  iftProductionOrgId=2af3b...d3
  iftProductionAuthURL=https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/identity-proxy/exchange_token/v1/organization/
  iftIntegrationURL=https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/connector/v1/assets
  iftProductionURL=https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/connector/v1/assets

```

## Usage

Complete the following steps to configure your system users to automatically obtain and renew authentication tokens:

  1. <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/docs/files/as-is-code-samples/IBMFoodTrust-java-springboot-sample.tgz'}>Download
  the tar file</a> and extract the contents to a working directory.
  2. cd into the directory
  3. Modify `src/main/resource/config.properties` (per the instructions above)
  3. Execute `gradle wrapper` to build the project
  4. Run the jar: `java -jar build/libs/IFT_authentication_sample-*.jar`
  5. Post an XML payload to `localhost:8080` e.g.:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080 \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
     -d '<insert XML text here>'
     ```
