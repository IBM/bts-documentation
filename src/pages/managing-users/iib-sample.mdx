<PageDescription>

**IBM Integration Bus (IIB)** is a message bus platform that allows for enterprise-level
message handling. Use of IIB assumes that you are already familiar with IIB v10, as
documented in
the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.msgbroker.helphome.doc/help_home_msgbroker.htm" target="_blank">IBM Knowledge Center</a>.

## Usage

The <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/docs/files/IIB/IIB_IFT_authentication_library.zip'}>IIB_IFT_authentication_library.zip</a> zip
file is a shared library that handles the communication interchange with the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ authentication service.

The <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/docs/files/IIB/IIB_IFT_submit_XML_API.zip'}>IIB_IFT_submit_XML_API.zip</a> zip
file is a full end-to-end sample that includes the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ authentication library. It is
an HTTP REST service that accepts an XML message and uploads it to the solution network. This
can be dropped into your existing IIB environment and customized to fit your needs.

Download the zip files and import them into your IIB Toolkit: **File -> Import... -> Project Interchange**.

## Code walkthrough

Because IIB handles messages in the SOAP format natively, some nodes were added to the flows to give the
look and feel of a REST API. For example, instead of having subflows encapsulated in TryCatch nodes
and throwing errors, local environment variables are set and checked via FilterNodes. A compute node
at the end of the main IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ submit XML API flow checks these variables and sets a 500 response
header with a meaningful JSON response (to match the format of a successful 201 response).

**Local environment variables**

The flows utilize the following variable structure:
- LocalEnvironment
  - Variables
    - IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
      - environment - *name of the target IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ environment (e.g. PRODUCTION)*
      - apikey
      - orgId
      - xml - *The XMLNS object of the XML string passed into the flow*
      - error_message - *message received from an API call*
      - error_location - *name of the subflow where the error originated from*
      - error_message_detail - *full context from the API error*
      - iam_token
        - access_token
        - token_type
        - expires_in
        - expiration
        - scope
      - service_token
    - message_backup

### 1. Submit XML (subflow)

**Flow highlights:**

1. Call subflow node: Call the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™_Authenticate subflow (see below)
2. Filter node: Check to see if the exchange token process was successful.
3. HTTP Request node: Submit the XML payload to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ with the API key acquired from the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™_Authenticate subflow

### 2. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ authentication (subflow)

**Flow highlights:**

1. Java compute node: Check the local environment variable for an existing token expiration value. If one exists, check it against the current time and if it has expired, obtain a new one; otherwise, skip the flow (too many calls to the obtain IBM Cloud IAM Service will be denied)
2. Compute node: Back up the existing message since the HTTP Request nodes will overwrite it.
3. Java compute node: Call the IBM Cloud IAM service, request a token and store the token in LocalEnvironment Variables.
4. HTTP request node: Call the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ Authentication API and exchange the token for a service token.
5. Compute node: Store the service token in a local environment variable.
6. Compute node: Restore the original inbound message into the message body.


### 3. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ submit XML API flow

The flow is configured for the HTTP path: `/ift_submit_xml/`

**Flow highlights**

1. Compute node: Read the inbound JSON payload and store the values in local
environment variables. Note -- the XML payload was stored as a string, so this node
converts the node into a proper XMLNS format and stores it as a local environment variable.
2. Call subflow node: Call the Submit_IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™_XML subflow from the shared
library (see above for details).
3. Filter node: Check a local environment variable to see if an error message exists
and route as needed.
4. Compute node: Format the error response.

## Try it out!

Once deployed to your IIB integration node, you can send a JSON payload through
the flow. The flow expects the following format:

**URL format:** `http://<integration node>:<debug port>/ift_submit_xml/`

**Payload format:**

**Note**: If your organization is registered in the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ sandbox
environment, you can specify `"environment": "SANDBOX",`

```json
{
  "environment":  "PRODUCTION",
  "apikey":  "...",
  "orgId": "...",
  "xml" : "<?xml version=\"1.0\" ...."
}
```
