<PageDescription>

**IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** manages the issuance and maintenance of **access tokens**, also
known as authentication tokens, service tokens, or JSON web tokens (JWT). Each
registered user (human, system, or application) must obtain an access token in
order to use IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

## User types

IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ classifies users into two types:

1. **Human users** are authenticated via their identity service
(<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html" target="_blank">IBMid</a>)
username (email address) and password. Authenticated human users can interact
directly with the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ network.

2. **System users** (systems and applications) are authenticated via system ID,
client ID and secret (token). A system user ID must also be created for any
application program that calls IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ APIs.
