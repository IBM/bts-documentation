<PageDescription>

To verify document authenticity and chain of custody, **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**
supports cryptographic signatures for all submitted XML. Signing of all XML documents
should be done using a supported algorithm (rsa-sha256 or ecdsa-sha256).

</PageDescription>

## Cryptographic signatures

For verification of signed data, the submitter must register public keys by submitting
a key registration document to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. The key registration document should
itself be signed using the corresponding private key.

Remove contact information fields from XML documents before cryptographic signing,
because subsequent modification of data by IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ would invalidate the
signature provided by the submitter.

## Sample public signing key XML

Refer to the following sample public signing key XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ift:publicSigningKey xmlns:ift="urn:ibm:ift:xsd:1">
  <!-- XML message to communicate encoded public signing keys to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.-->
  <!-- NOTE : Comments for a field appear BELOW the field. -->
  <keyID>12345</keyID>
  <!--Mandatory: Identifier for this public signing key. Should be unique (within your organization).-->
  <algorithm>rsa-sha256</algorithm>
  <!--Mandatory: Digital signing algorithm that this key should be used with.-->
  <!--Should be either rsa-sha256 or ecdsa-sha256.-->
  <encodedPublicKey>c7be1dd4d4899 ...</encodedPublicKey>
  <!--Mandatory: Encoded public signing key, represented as a base-64 encoded string.-->
</ift:publicSigningKey>
```
