<PageDescription>

To facilitate **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** data uploads, you can register an **application**
as an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ **system user** and configure the application to submit
credentials and upload XML data (products, facilities, events, and transactions).

</PageDescription>

## GDPR notice

**Attention**: To comply with <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank">EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> data privacy requirements, you must ensure that no
personal data is uploaded to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ in any free-form text fields or in any comments.

## Summary

IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ APIs enable authenticated, authorized users, including human
users, system users, and applications, to upload data to the network. To successfully upload asset
XML, authenticated users must submit their credentials with each API call. Once the data is
validated and accepted by IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, the assets are available for sharing
with your selected IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ business partners.

The steps that follow illustrate the flow of creating an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ system ID
for an application and submitting data to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ through API calls:

1. To call an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ API, the application (system user) must have a registered
system ID. An organization administrator must create the system ID using the <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'} target="_blank">
Users module</a> and manually record the generated system ID, client ID, and secret (password) for
the application. These credentials must then be stored in a form that is consumable by the
application&mdash;as a configuration file or environment variables, for example.
2. The application submits its system ID, client ID and secret in a call to the
authorization API access token endpoint. If successful, the API returns an access
token (JSON web token/JWT) to the application.
3. The application submits its received access token (JWT) in a POST call to the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
API Asset endpoint, to upload assets to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. Information
about the created asset is returned to the application.

## Authentication

IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ allows only authenticated users to upload data. To authenticate
applications, refer to the <a href="../managing-users/authenticate-system-users">authenticate system
users</a> documentation.

## Connector API

The IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/connector/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Connector API</a>
enables authenticated users to upload data to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

### User-Agent request header

When submitting requests programmatically to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ APIs, set the **User-Agent**
request header to a string with your organization name. Optionally, the program
name and version can be added to the string.

Example using organization name:
```
User-Agent: organizationName
```

Example using organization name, program name, and program version:
```
User-Agent: organizationName-ProgramName/1.0
```

### Post Asset XML

Call the **Assets** endpoint to submit an XML message to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ in the
[required format](/reference/data-types). For help generating XML messages in
the correct format, a [spreadsheet converter](/onboarding/convert-spreadsheets)
is available.

#### Swagger

The <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/connector/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Connector API</a> endpoints are
provided in Swagger:

| HTTP Method| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/fs/connector/v1/assets` | Submits XML to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ |

For authentication, the registered user's access token [JWT](#authentication) must
be submitted in the `Authorization` header of the POST request:

| Header Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization | `Bearer` + `' '` (a space character) +  [Access Token (JWT)](#authentication) |

#### Responses

One of three responses is typically returned by this endpoint:

| Response | Meaning |
| --- | ---|
| 201 | Asset Created|
| 400 | Error in XML|
| 401 | User Unauthorized |

#### Error responses

401: User Unauthorized.  A 401 response indicates a problem with the credentials
(username/password/client_id) submitted to the endpoint. Ensure that the correct
credentials for a system ID created using the <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'} target="_blank">Users
module</a> are submitted.

400: Bad Data.  A 400 response indicates a problem with the uploaded data. The
response includes a detailed description of the problem.

For additional information, refer to [API error messages](/reference/api-error-messages).
