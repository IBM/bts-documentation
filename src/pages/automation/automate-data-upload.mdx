<PageDescription>

The **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™** APIs are provided for your data integration experts to automate
data uploads for your organization. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ APIs are simple REST APIs, so the
automated process is similar to manually uploading data. To automate, a registered IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
system user for your organization will authenticate and upload conforming XML data.

## GDPR notice

**Attention**: To comply with <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank">EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> data privacy requirements, you must ensure that no
personal data is uploaded to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ in any free-form text fields or in any comments.

## IDs and tokens

IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ runs on IBM Cloud, so the **service ID** that you create for your
**system user** must first be configured for both environments. First, the service ID must
authenticate to IBM Cloud using the API key (password) and request a **Cloud IAM token**. Using the
Cloud IAM token, the system user must then authenticate the Service ID to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
and request a service token for IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. This service token is then used
by the system user to authenticate API calls, until the token expires (after 3 hours).

## Preparing for automation

Complete the following steps to prepare for automating your IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ data uploads:

1. Obtain the **product and facility identifiers** (GS1 or IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™) that your supply chain experts
have mapped.
2. Verify that the product and facility identifiers have been registered with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.
3. Identify your critical supply chain events and translate them into their corresponding EPCIS events.
4. Prepare templates for the EPCIS events, in either XML or Spreadsheet format (Microsoft&reg; Excel&trade;).
To facilitate automated workloads for a variety of environments, process flexibility is provided. For example,
you could build templates for each EPCIS event for a product, for groups of similar products, or based on the
event type.
5. Determine which of the optional fields to use for EPCIS events, if any.
6. Decide how to capture the data for your EPCIS templates. Any data not available from your
current environment
will need to be generated. For example, EPCIS events require a Universally Unique Identifier
(UUID), which in most cases requires new code.

## Automation methodology

To automate your **EPCIS** event uploads to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, apply the following methodology.
**Your automation code must**:

1. Generate or collect the required EPCIS event data.
2. Create and complete the EPCIS event XML file.
3. Upload the XML file using the Connector API.
4. Handle errors resulting from the REST API calls.

To facilitate error handling, **your automation code should also** provide the following functionality:

1. Error check the HTTP request and response. The HTTP request could fail if there are network
connection issues between the HTTP client and IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™. The HTTP response
from IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ could contain an error code if there are problems with the
request, such as a 401 authorization error or a 400 invalid XML format error. Your automation code
should include specific error handling, such as printing error messages to application logs and
retrying the request.
2. Save: a) the **assetIdUri** from the JSON returned by the Connector API POST request; b) the **UUID** of the
event loaded; and c) **details of the event** for future reference or debugging.

## Event data rules

Apply the following rules when automating your **EPCIS event** uploads to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™:

- Event IDs must be unique to be viewed in the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ UI, so **using UUIDs is highly recommended**.
- Any **duplicate event IDs** are replaced in the UI by the most recent upload, but are not overwritten on
blockchain.
- An erroneous event upload cannot be removed from blockchain, but it can be removed from the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ UI by
uploading a new event with the **identical Event ID.**
- **Events cannot be combined into a single event**. For example, a commission event is required when a product
instance is created, and an aggregation event is required when the product is packed and shipped.
- For any specific supply chain product scenario, the order in which the events are uploaded has no effect on the
sequential ordering of the supply chain events. Only the event timestamps in the XML uploads determine the sequential
ordering of supply chain events.

## Automation overview

As described in the [Automation procedure](#automation-procedure) below, you will complete the following steps to
configure a system user for automated data uploads:

1. Configure an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ **system user**.
2. Create an IBM Cloud **Service ID** and API key (password).
3. For the IBM Cloud Service ID, create a **system ID** in the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ UI.
4. Use the Service ID API key to generate an IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management
(Cloud IAM) **service token**.
5. Use the Cloud IAM token to generate a service token for **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™**.
6. To authorize the client to send XML data to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, specify the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
service token in the **authorization header** of each API call.
7. Regenerate IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ **service tokens** as needed; they expire every 3 hours.

## Automation procedure

Complete each step below to configure your **system users** for automated data
upload to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™:

### 1. Configure an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ system user

a. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/registration" target="_blank">Create an IBM Cloud
account</a> if you do not already have one.

b. Sign in to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/login" target="_blank">IBM Cloud
Service IDs</a> with your IBMid.

c. Click the **Create** button. Enter a **name** and a **description**, and click
the **Create** button.

d. **Copy and Save the "ServiceId" value** at the top of the screen (for example,
**ServiceId-4807b3fb-11d9-4304-b3da-8205a77d6f8a**). This value is required to register
the Service ID with IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

e. Click the **API keys** tab and then click the **Create** button.

f. Enter a name and description and click the **Create** button.

g. Click the **Download** button and **save the value of the API key to a secure
location**. The API key is the password for the service ID. If the API key is lost
it cannot be regenerated, which would require creating a new Service ID. Copy and
save or download the API key. Once the API key is securely saved and readable, close
the window.

### 2. Define the Service ID as an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ system ID

The next step is to define the IBM Cloud Service ID as an IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ system ID:

a. From the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ UI menu, select the **Users** module.

b. Select the **system IDS** tab and click the **Create** button.

c. Record your **Organization ID**, which is required for future token generation steps.

d. Enter the IBM Cloud **Service ID** as the **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ system ID** and click
the **Add system ID** button.

e. Press the **Close** button. The system ID will be created.

**Attention**: The examples below use an HTTP client for illustration purposes. For
automation, simply integrate these HTTP requests into your user application code.

### 3. Generate an IBM Cloud IAM service token

Use the system ID API key from the previous step to generate an IBM Cloud Identity
and Access Management (Cloud IAM) token.

Use the following HTTP request for the IBM Cloud IAM service token format:

```
POST https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token
Header: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Body: grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
A successful response is an HTTP 200 message that includes the IBM Cloud IAM service
token. You will send this token to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ in exchange for a service token
for IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.

### 4. Generate a service token for IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™

Use the Cloud IAM token to generate a service token for IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, using
the following HTTP format:

```
POST
https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/identity-proxy/exchange_token/v1/organization/{Org_Id}
Header: Content-Type: application/json
Body: The entire JSON response from the Cloud IAM token in step 2
```
A successful response is an HTTP 200 message that includes the IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service
token.

**Attention**: Only the **onboarding_token** value is used in subsequent requests,
not the entire  returned JSON string.

### 5. Specify IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token

To authorize the client to upload XML data to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™, specify the **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™
service token** in the **authorization header** of each API call.

From the generated IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service token, specify only the **onboarding_token**
value (no double quotation marks) in the **authorization header**. This **Bearer token**
authorization requires the authorization header format of 'Bearer onboarding_token_value'.

The following example API call demonstrates the required **authorization header** format:

```
POST https://<solution domain name>/ift/api/connector/fs/connector/v1/assets
Header: Content-Type: application/json
Header: Authorization: Bearer ONBOARDING_token_VALUE
Body: IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ conforming XML
```
A successful response is an HTTP 201 message that includes the asset ID.

### 6. Generate new IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service tokens

Generate new **IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ service tokens** as needed; they expire after 3 hours. If an
expired service token is specified with an API call, an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) message is
returned. New tokens can be generated at any time; the system user does not have to wait
until the current token has expired. To maximize the active duration, the current token
can be cached and reused.

The following simple approaches can be used to generate a new service token to replace
an expired or expiring token:

- Request a new a token after getting a 401 for the current token. The application must
also retry the failed request(s).
- To avoid authorization failures, set a timer for fewer than 3 hours when generating a
service token. When the timer elapses, the application can generate a new service token.
